# Pomodoro Timer with Neopixel

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?
see [LifeHacker](http://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730)

> The methodology is simple: When faced with any large task or series of tasks, break the work down into short, timed intervals (called "Pomodoros") that are spaced out by short breaks. This trains your brain to focus for short periods and helps you stay on top of deadlines or constantly-refilling inboxes. With time it can even help improve your attention span and concentration.

## What am I trying to accomplish?
The goal here is to create a Pomodoro Timer using the Neopixel and Arduino. Rather than program an LCD screen to display the time, the Neopixel is instead programmed to be a visually appealing time indicator.
